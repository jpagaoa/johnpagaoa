               <h3>Project Objective</h3>
               This is Cadbury chocolate milk flavoured with orange. The objective goal was to pick any flavour to pair with Cadbury chocolate, and then I had to create a logo for the flavour I chosed. 
               <h3>Target Audience</h3>
               12-25 years old who enjoy drinking orange juice without worrying about consuming too much sugar.
               <h3>Concept</h3>
               The logo I want to incorporate a fresh orange juice with the straw straight to orange. It feels more organic and fresh. I added leaf onto the straw and added a strong punch of green for additional contrast, so the logo doesn't feel a little bit warm feeling in terms of colour palette.
               <h3>Challenges</h3>
               The design concept here is minimal; I had to keep the original colour and font of Cudbary and some other elements that I don't fully control.
               <h3>Design Process</h3>
               For the font, I have to use the original font of Cadbury branding, but the colour I had to add my own choice, but I have to limit the use of colour to remain the feel of the original design
