               <h3>Project Objective</h3>

               This project aims to create an app that provides many features to help pet owner's and dogs' information in general. These features are training, matchmaker, coaching tip and many more. 
               <h3>Target Audience</h3>
               The target audience was newly pet owners who have very limited knowledge about a dog. 20-28-year-old starting a new life and wants dogs as companionship. 40-50 and 60-65 seeking lifelong companionship.
               <h3>Concept</h3>
               This app is very simple and clean. Hierarchy and white space are my primary design principle. The design is very straight forward considering some categories of my target audiences are elderly people. The primary colour is brown; it's friendly and approachable. Also loyal, trustworthy and dependable. The blue and darker versions of blues are my secondary, as well as red for extra contras for the design. For the typeface, I used Avenir, very clean and professional suitable for my overall design.  
               <h3>Challenges</h3>
               In the process of making this app, I came along with many challenges along the way. These are the competitors slightly similar to this project goal in order to stand up against the competitors. I added features that most competitors don't have. For example, features like coupons will be given away via subscription or registered member of this app. Match Maker is also targeting people who are planning to get a dog in the future. These added features definitely a step ahead of competitors. 
               <h3>Outcome</h3>
               This project delivered exactly the goal or even better prior to the starting point of the project. This app definitely can compete with other competitors out there. It has more features and easy to use. This app is very friendly and welcoming. 
               <h3>Design Process</h3>
               The first stage of this design is to research all the issues of pet owners that they are dealing with their dogs. Once all the statistics and information are collected. I move to poster design that helps to create awareness in a local charity. The final part of this project is to create an app with a variety of helpful features that definitely helps every individual who owns a dog and planning to get a dog in the future. This app has it all.
