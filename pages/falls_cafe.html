               <h3>Project Objective</h3>
               This project was to create a logo identity of a coffee shop located in Niagara Falls. This coffee shop is selling not only premade coffee but signature bulk coffee.

               <h3>Concept</h3>
               It is very unique made specify here in Niagara Falls. The logo is symmetrical with two meanings, waves from the falls and once combine side by side logo resembling the shape of a heart. The heart represents romantic love and affection. Many tourists pick Niagara fall destination for their honeymoon. This logo is suitable for its identity.

               <h3>Challenges</h3>
               The challenge for this project was that the client doesn't want to include a coffee cup/mugs and coffee beans/leaf part of the logo. Instead of He wanted that speaks to the native Niagara falls brand. 
               <h3>Outcome</h3>
               The brand identity was unique, and it represents the theme of the falls
               <h3>Design Process</h3>
               The first phase was to create many variations of a logo that is unique of its kind and has multiple meanings. Once identify the right logo, I had to explore possible outcomes. The last step was to clean and make it simplified as possible.
