               <h3>Overview</h3>
               For this project, I conduct an in-depth analysis and research the impact of emerging trends on design. This project will explore 4 issues facing the individual designer and the package design industry.
               <br>
                <br>1. Emerging trend: One-use packaging. How can we improve packaging that is intended to have only one use, which is to deliver a product, then it is put in the garbage or for recycling.
                <br>
                <br>2. Emerging trend: Second-use packaging. How can we improve packaging that is intended to have only one use but design it so it can be used for something else.
                <br>
                <br>3. Emerging trend: Designing print that can easily be recycled. What materials and design printing techniques could a designer incorporate that would improve the recycling process. 
               <h3>Design Process</h3>
               a package design that is intended for one-use, then to be discarded, and that is negatively affecting our environment and “over-designed” or uses excess stuffing or plastic coverings. 
                For the design for this project, I used packaging seeds and minimized the use of colour.
